# QuickSign

Made this because I needed to put customizable HTML-based content onto a display running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Warning: probably really bad. I wrote this in like two hours. Will update as needed.

## Current Features  

- Basic HTML View that auto-refreshes on update
- Upload/Replace protected by basic user/pass system

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. edit index.js: change the admin password
3. Profit?
